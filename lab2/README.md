# Lab-02 | Implementing a bubble/selection sort in C

## Feedback
Great job! I expected that you will implement other functions as well :) 

Note that yoour `sortChar_bubbleSort.c` doesn't return a value (you free it before returning. This is a potential bug. 

In `bubble_sort.c` I recommend to use brackets for both loops as it will save you from some bugs :)
